# Cura-Dremel-3D20-Plugin
Dremel Ideabuilder 3D20 plugin for [Cura version 3.x](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software).  This plugin enables the user to export the proprietary .g3drem files using Cura.  This code is **heavily** based upon the [cura gcode writer plugin](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/tree/master/plugins/GCodeWriter) and has been hacked together in an afternoon.  Although the software functions reasonably well for the author, the author will not guarantee that the software won't break your 3d printer, set it on fire, or do other really bad things.  The software is supplied without warranty and you are responsible if you use this software and bad things happen either to you, your 3D printer, or any of your other propery as a result of using this software, or the files that it creates.  Please remain near your 3D printer while using files generated by this software, and pay close attention to the 3D printer to verify that the machine is functioning properly. Any usage of this software and it's output is strictly at your own risk.

# Usage
Once the plugin has been installed you can use it by following the steps outlined below:
**1.** open cura
**2.** select the Dremel 3D20 as your printer (cura->preferences->printers->add)
![Select the Dremel 3D20](/docs/addprinter.png)

**3.** select Dremel PLA or any other PLA filament as your filament type
![Select the dremel pla](/docs/selectpla.png)

**4.** Set the slicing options that you want.

**5.** (Optional, but recommended) Zoom in on the part until it fills the screen.  As the plugin saves out the .g3drem file it will grab a screenshot of the main cura window for use as the preview image that is displayed on the Ideabuilder screen. The area inside the red box shown in the image below (but not in the actual cura window when you use the plugin) is what will be used in the screenshot.  The preview on the Dremel is **much** better if you zoom in on the part that you're printing until the part fills the screenshot area.  

For instance:
![Zoom in on the part](/docs/Zoom_For_Screenshot.PNG)

Produces:
![Ideabuilder Screen](docs/Ideabuilder_screen.jpg)

**6.** Click "File->Save As", or "save to file", selecting .g3drem as the output file format.

![Save as .g3drem file](/docs/saveas.PNG)

**7.** Save this file to a SD card
**8.** Insert the SD card into your IdeaBuilder 3D20
**9.** Turn on the printer
**10.** Select the appropriate file to print.  
    ~~Currently the cura icon~~ ![cura icon](plugins/DremelGCodeWriter/cura80x60.bmp) ~~will be shown on the Dremel IdeaBuilder screen as the preview.~~  
    **New - [Version 0.2](https://github.com/timmehtimmeh/Cura-Dremel-3D20-Plugin/releases/tag/v0.2):** The plugin now grabs a screenshot of the main cura window as it saves out the file (see step 5)
**11.** Click print
**12.** Enjoy - if you have any feature suggestions or encounter issues, feel free to raise them in the issues section above!

# Note
Please note the following:
* This plugin has only been tested on Cura 3.0.4 on Windows 10, and MacOS Sierra (MacOS 10.12) but there's no reason why it shouldn't work on linux as well.  If you are using another platform and encounter issues with the plugin, feel free to raise an issue with the "Issues" option above (in github)
* The Dremel 3D20 printer file json has not been optimized at all - if you have time and want to improve this file please do so and contribute the changes back.
  * While this plugin works in the basic print case, you may encounter problems with the print head crashing into your parts if you attempt to print multiple parts on the same print bed one-after-another instead of printing them all-at-once.
* The .g3drem file format is not fully understood yet - I've done a bit of reverse engineering on the file format, as described here: http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?263,785652 and have used the information I discovered to create this plugin, however there are still magic numbers in the dremel header that may or may not have an effect on the print.  See more information in the [Technical Details below](#Technical_Details).

# Wishlist
The following items would be great to add to this plugin - as I get time I'll work on them, but I'd welcome any collaboration
* ~~Replace the generic bitmap with a bitmap of the actual part being printed~~
    * Improve the picture of the part being printed as displayed on the IdeaBuilder screen
        * to auto-zoom and focus the screenshot on the part being printed, although I quite like giving the user the option of how to position the view, so this may not get implemented
        * ~~to not include the extra GUI on the right~~,
        * ~~to not include the extra GUI on the top and left~~

* Better understanding of the remaining unknown items in the Dremel .g3drem file format
* ~~Optimized Dremel3D20 json file with support for Dremel brand PLA~~
* Optimization of Dremel brand PLA settings

# <a name="Technical_Details"></a>Technical Details of the .g3drem header file Format
The g3drem file format consists of a few sections.  The header is a mix of binary data and ASCII data, but the ASCII section is written in binary format for ease.

**An Example of the binary header looks like this:**

`67 33 64 72 65 6d 20 31 2e 30 20 20 20 20 20 20`  
`3a 00 00 00 b0 38 00 00 b0 38 00 00 7e 01 00 00`  
`be 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 19 00 03 00`  
`64 00 00 00 dc 00 00 00 01 ff [80x60 Bmp image]`  
`[standard 3d printer gcode]`  

**The sections of the header are:**
1. ASCII text 'g3drem 1.0      ' = 67 33 64 72 65 6d 20 31 2e 30 20 20 20 20 20 20
2. Some magic numbers that seem to be the same for every file = 3a 00 00 00 b0 38 00 00 b0 38 00 00
3. 4 byte little-endian integer representing the number of minutes the print will take = 7e 01 00 00
4. 4 byte little-endian integer representing the estimated number of millimeters of filament that the print will use = be 01 00 00
5. Some more magic numbers that seem to be the same for every file 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 19 00 03 00
64 00 00 00 dc 00 00 00 01 ff
6. An 80x60 bitmap containing the image that the Dremel 3D20 will use to display on the screen
7. Standard 3d printer gcode

**Interesting observations about the file format:**
1.  The maximum number of minutes that the dremel can read is 0xFFFFFF00, which comes out to 4660 hours and 20 minutes (this would show up in the file as FF FF FF 00)
2.  The maximum fiament length that the file can handle is hex 0xFFFFFFFF, or 4,294,967,295 millimeters. The dremel software reports (after some rounding): 4,294,967.5 meters
3.  The image size seems to be hardcoded inside the dremel firmware (at least for firmware 1.3.20160621).  Storing an image that is larger than 80x60 is allowable in the file, and the Dremel 3D software will read this file with a larger image with no problem.  The Dremel 3D sofware will read and show the correct part to build, but loading this file with the larger image into the actual Ideabuilder will result in the ideabuilder showing the image, and allowing the user to select it, but will result in the Ideabuilder rebooting when the user tries to print the file.
